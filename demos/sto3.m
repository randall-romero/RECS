%% STO3 Anticipated switch to a public storage policy
% We consider here the transitional dynamics that occurs when a public storage
% policy defending a floor price is announced a few periods before its
% beginning. This is a finite-horizon problem in which the terminal condition is
% not a unique situation, but a state-contingent policy function. This is a
% transition from problem <sto1.html STO1> to <sto2.html STO2>.

%% Create the model objects
Mu                = 1;
sigma             = 0.05;

%%
% *Competitive storage model:*
model1 = recsmodel('sto1.yaml',struct('Mu',Mu,'Sigma',sigma^2,'order',7));
%%
% *Floor price model:*
model2 = recsmodel('sto2.yaml',struct('Mu',Mu,'Sigma',sigma^2,'order',7));

%% Define approximation space
[interp,s] = recsinterpinit(50,min(model1.shocks.e)*0.95,2);

%% Terminal condition: solve for the infinite-horizon behavior under policy
% See <sto2.html STO2> for details.

%%
% *Find a first guess through the perfect foresight solution*
interp2 = recsFirstGuess(interp,model2,s,[],[],struct('T',5));

%%
% *Solve for rational expectations*
[~,x2] = recsSolveREE(interp2,model2,s);

%% Transition: model without policy in finite horizon
% The policy is announced 6 periods before it begins (so $T=7$). In the seventh
% period, the equilibrium is the one defined by the problem with public storage:
T          = 7;
xT         = x2(:,1:3);
options.eqsolver = 'ncpsolve'; % lmmcp does not work in this case
[~,X]  = recsSolveREEFiniteHorizon(interp,model1,s,x2(:,1:3),xT,T,options);

%% Initial period: model without policy under infinite horizon
% In period 0, the policy is not expected by the agents and the prevailing
% equilibrium is the one corresponding to the infinite-horizon competitive
% storage problem (<sto1.html STO1>):
[~,x1] = recsSolveREE(interp,model1,s,X(:,1:3,1));
